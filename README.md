# Vet clinic database: create animals table

> In this project, I will use a relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic. I will create a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database.
